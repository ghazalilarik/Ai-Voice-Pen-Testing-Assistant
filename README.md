# Ai-Voice-Pen-Testing-Assistant
This Project helps users conduct basic penetration testing on their home networks through voice commands. Users can instruct the assistant to run reconnaissance, port scans, and vulnerability assessments. The tool uses Nmap to conduct network testing and a combination of voice recognition and synthesis to provide a voice-controlled user experience.
